Features

Key features of the repository (e.g., autoencoder for denoising, U-Net + Conformer for source separation).

Requirements

List of dependencies and installation instructions.

Data Preprocessing

Explanation of how EMG data is loaded, normalized, and prepared for training.

Model Architecture

Details about the autoencoder model, U-Net, and Conformer blocks.

Training

Step-by-step guide on training the models, including TensorBoard integration.

Evaluation

Metrics used to evaluate model performance (e.g., MSE, R2 score).

Export Models

Instructions for exporting the trained model to ONNX and TFLite formats for deployment.

How to Use

Example usage for running the models, including how to make predictions.

Contributing

Guidelines for contributing to the project.
